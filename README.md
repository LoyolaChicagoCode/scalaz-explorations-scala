My ongoing explorations of scalaz.

There are several good reasons to use scalaz:

- You get the F#-style forward pipe operator `|>`.
- You get a proper Tree type (like Haskell's rose tree).
- You get common abstractions such as Functor across predefined types
  otherwise not formally related.
- Various excellent libraries leverage scalaz.

For simplicity and agility, these explorations are organized as worksheets.
