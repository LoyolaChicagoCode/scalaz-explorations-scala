My ongoing explorations of scalaz. For simplicity and agility, these are organized as IntelliJ IDEA worksheets.

There are several good reasons to use scalaz:

- You get the F#-style forward pipe operator `|>`.
- You get a proper Tree type (like Haskell's rose tree) and lots of other nice stuff from Haskell.
- You get common abstractions such as Functor across predefined types
  otherwise not formally related (higher-kinded typing).
- Various excellent libraries leverage scalaz.

An excellent, accessible, and pragmatic scalaz intro is available here:
